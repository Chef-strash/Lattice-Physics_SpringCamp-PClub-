# Lattice-Physics_SpringCamp-PClub-

This repository is a submission to Machine Learning Spring Camp Selection Tasks, SpringCamp conducted by PClub at IIT Kanpur.

This Repository contains 3 .ipynb files:
->SpringCamp_ML_Lattice_Physics : This file contails all the tested models used for predicting the Targets(KINF & PPPF).
->GridSearchCV                  : This file contains an imprementaion of GridSearchCV performed on "Polynomial Regressor Model".
->Hyperparametric_Tuning        : This file contains an implementaion of Hyperparametric Tuning using Optuna on The CNN Regressor.
